# apex-cheating
I'm releasing all my source and tools to do with Apex Legends today because I generally feel that cheating has brought a general negative impact upon me and I feel that leaving this community and quitting cheating will result in a better mental state for me on the average day.

# UC-Apex-Remastered
An Apex Legends cheat based off the BaconToaster's [UC-Apex-Remastered](https://github.com/BaconToaster/UC-Apex-Remastered). However is basically entirely rewritten and has little resemblence to the original.

# apexbot
An Apex Legends offset dumper written by CasualX/CasualHacker slightly modified to add download buttons.

# Random
A collection of random snippets related to Apex Legends in one way or another

## DumpSVGs.js
A script that extracts the SVGs from the Apex Legends wiki originally planned to be used for weapon esp but was never implemented.

## Dump Offsets.bat
A script specific to my computer which I will not include instructions on how to set it up, essentially drag a dumped Apex exe on it and it will extract stdout and open the apexbot folder.

## Dumps
A folder containing offset dumps generated using apexbot.

## Bypass.bat
A script meant to be put inside your Apex Legends folder which renames the r5apex to EasyAntiCheat_launcher.exe and vice versa, if already renamed it does the opposite.

## svgs
A folder with the svgs exported and downloaded from DumpSVGs.js

# HWID Spoofer
An obsurdly simple hardware ID spoofer written in C# which somehow has worked for months.
